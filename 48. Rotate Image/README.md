You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

Note:

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example 1:

Given input matrix =  <br> 
[<br>
  `[1,2,3]`,<br>
  `[4,5,6]`,<br>
  `[7,8,9]`<br>
],<br>

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:<br> 
[<br> 
  `[7,4,1]`,    <br> 
  `[8,5,2]`,   <br> 
  `[9,6,3]`   <br> 
]
