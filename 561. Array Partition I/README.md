Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

**Example 1:** <br>
Input: `[1,4,3,2]`

Output: 4 <br>
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
<br><br>Note:
n is a positive integer, which is in the range of `[1, 10000]`.<br>
All the integers in the array will be in the range of `[-10000, 10000]`.
